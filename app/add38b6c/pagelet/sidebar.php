<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>Well, most people call it a "sidebar" and place information about authors or sites here. Lately a lot of people have been using it for twitter updates or flickr feeds.</p>

<div class="clearhr"></div>

<h2>Change me!</h2>
<p>Many pages load this "sidebar-pagelet", giving you a chance to edit your own content here. After all, not every page needs the full page width</p>
